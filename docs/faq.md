# FAQ

## Audio Quality

The audio recording exhibits a brief static interference at the beginning. However, this initial noise does not impact the quality of the transcription process. A visual representation of the audio recording is available in the repository.

## Picture Quality

The current picture quality is suboptimal, with text being unreadable in the captured images. This is a known limitation that affects the visual output.

*Note: This FAQ will be updated as more questions arise and improvements are made to the frame-assistant.*

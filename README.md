## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Conda

If you donâ€™t already have Conda installed, download and install it from the official [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) websites. Follow the installation steps for your Windows system.

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

Once Conda is installed, open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Anaconda Prompt) and run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n frame-dev python=3.9
```

This will create an isolated environment named `frame-dev` with Python 3.9.

### 3. Install Required Python Packages

Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate frame-dev
```

Then install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install frame-sdk
pip install frame-utilities-for-python
pip install frameutils
pip install keyboard
```

## Downloading Whisper Standalone

To use the **Whisper** executable required by this project, download the latest version of the Whisper Standalone for Windows:

1. Visit the [Whisper Standalone Repository](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win).
2. Download the latest release ZIP file for your Windows version.
3. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice, such as:

   ```
   C:\Users\bjorn\Downloads\Faster-Whisper-XXL_r239.1_windows
   ```
5. Set the `WHISPER_EXE_PATH` variable in the `main.py` file to the path where you extracted the Whisper Standalone ZIP.
6. Make sure you install CUDA 12 libraries for the Whisper Standalone. https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us

## Run the Project

After setting up the Conda environment and downloading Whisper Standalone, follow these steps:

1. Activate the Conda environment:

```bash
conda activate frame-dev
```

2. Run the project using the following command:

```bash
python .\main.py
```

---

## Change Whisper Executable Path

The path to the Whisper executable is defined on **line 8** of the `main.py` file. Update the value of the `WHISPER_EXE_PATH` variable to match the path where you extracted the Whisper Standalone ZIP.

For example:

```python
WHISPER_EXE_PATH = r"C:\Users\bjorn\Downloads\Faster-Whisper-XXL_r239.1_windows\Faster-Whisper-XXL\faster-whisper-xxl.exe"
```

Ensure the path matches your system setup.
